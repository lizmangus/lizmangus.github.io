I began my journey into the world of Software Engineering simply for a career change. I am currently working as a Dental Assistant and I've found that I enjoy it but it is not something I can see myself doing for 30+ years. I enjoy working on computers and use them daily so I thought to myself, "Why not make a career out this?" So I began to do some research on all of my options (self-teaching, bootcamps, and good ol' traditional college). I've found that personally, the bootcamp method seemed to be the most efficient. I also had to take in to consideration where the "tech world" is headed right now. Will job positions be opening up at a high rate over the course of the next 10, 20, 30 years? I came to the conclusion that a career in the tech industry is the way to go. Technology just keeps climbing and breaking new boundaries every year. That is something I need to have a part in. I believe it would be an amazing experience to create or truly be apart of something that people use in their every day lives (ex: Facebook, Twitter, Instacart).
